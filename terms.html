                                <h3 class="title">1. Using the Moway App </h3>
                                <p>1.1 To use the Moway app, you must register in Moway's mobile application and set up an account. At the time of the registration you must be eighteen (18) years of age. </p>
                                <p>You must provide us with the required personal information to register, including your phone number, email address and a valid payment method (cash, wallet, credit card or debit card). </p>
                                <p>You are under no obligation to log in to, or use, the Moway's app and neither are the Drivers. If you choose to stop using the Moway app you may do so without giving us any notice. </p>
                                <p>We may temporarily restrict your access to and use of the Moway app if there is a suspected breach of your obligations (see clause 6 below) or of these General Terms and Conditions, including where we receive a complaint in relation to fraud. There may be circumstances in which we are unable to provide you with information about the complaint whilst an investigation is ongoing by us and/or a third party such as the police. </p>
                                <p>1.2. Moway provides an information service through the Moway app that enables intervention of requests for transport services between passengers and Providers. Moway does not provide transport services. Transport services are provided by Providers following a booking made by you on the Moway app and under a contract (with you) for the conveyance of passengers. Prior to the booking confirmation, you will receive information on the applicable fares. Drivers provide transport services on an independent basis (either in person or on behalf of a company) as economic and professional service providers. Moway is not responsible in any way for the fulfilment of the contract entered into between the passenger (you) and the Provider. Disputes arising from consumer rights, legal obligations applicable to the provision of transport services will be resolved between the passengers and the Providers. Data regarding the Providers and their transport services is available in the Moway app and receipts for trips are sent to the email address listed in the passenger’s profile. </p>
                                <p>1.3 The passenger (you) enters into a contract with the Provider for the provision of transport services on the Moway app. Depending on the payment options supported for a given location of the trip, you can choose to pay the Provider for the transport service in cash or use Moway in-App Payment options, that is credit card, debit card or wallet. Payments for Moway Business rides are handled by a separate agreement for Business trips. We may provide an estimate of these charges but please be aware that the final amount charged to you may be different from the estimate. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges may include other applicable fees, tolls, and/or surcharges including a booking fee, city tolls, airport surcharges or processing fees for split payments. If you wish, you may also choose to tip the driver directly on the Moway in-App Payment. We may limit the maximum amount for a tip at our sole discretion. <br>Once the transport service has been provided by the Provider, Moway issue an invoice in the name and on behalf of the Provider.  </p>
                                <p>1.4 When installing the Moway app, the passenger’s mobile phone number is linked to the respective Moway user account and added to our database. If you are no longer using your mobile phone number, you must notify Moway within 7 days so we can remove it from your account data. Failure to notify us about any change to your phone number, may result in your mobile operator issuing the same mobile phone number to a new person who, when using the Moway app, may have access to your data. </p>
                                <p>1.5 You are responsible for all activity on your Moway app account.</p>
                                <p>1.6 Moway reserves the right to make social interactions available through the Moway app, such as the ability to contact you, or offer you to rate and comment on the Provider. </p>
                                <h3 class="title">2. Promotional Codes </h3>
                                <p>2.1 You hereby accept that Moway may send you promotional codes on a per promotion basis. Promotional code credit can be applied towards payment on completion of a trip or other features or benefits related to the transport service and/or other services provided by Moway (as applicable) and are subject to any additional terms that may be established on a per promotional code basis. Expiration dates of promo codes will be reflected in-app once you have applied the promo code to your account. </p>
                                <p>2.2 If your trip amount exceeds the redeemable credit allocated to your ride, the balance will be automatically deducted from your account’s payment method. Similarly, a promotional code credit only applies on a per ride basis and cannot carry over to a next trip and therefore will be forfeited. Only one promotional code may be applied per trip. </p>
                                <p>2.3 Moway reserves the right to cancel any promotional code at any time for any reason. This includes, but is not limited to, if Moway deems that codes are being used in an unlawful or fraudulent manner, those issued mistakenly, and those which have expired. </p>
                                <h3 class="title">3.Moway in-App Payment </h3>
                                <p>3.1 Depending on the preferred payment options, you can pay for the transport services with cash, a card, or in-app wallet on the Moway app. By providing Moway in-App Payment service, Moway acts as representative for the Providers of the transport services. Every Provider has authorised Moway as their representative for the intervention of conclusion of contracts between the Provider and the passenger, including the power to issue invoices in their name and on their behalf, accept in-App payments from the passengers and to forward the payments to the Provider. Your obligation to the Provider of the transport service will be fulfilled when the payment order is given to transfer funds to Moways’ bank account. You are responsible for ensuring that the payment takes place and ensuring that sufficient funds are available. </p>
                                <p>3.2 You may choose to Tip the Provider using the Moway In-app Payment service. The Tip can be paid via the In-app Payment by means authorised by Moway for that purpose. Moway will transfer the Tip to the Provider in full amount, excluding any taxes.

                                <h3 class="title">4. Ordering and Cancellation of Transport Services </h3>
                                <p>4.1 You can create requests for the provision of a transport service in the Moway app. This is an offer from you to a chosen Provider to conclude a transport contract. If a Provider accepts your offer, the transportation contract between you and the Provider is concluded on the terms and conditions you have agreed on with the Provider. You will be notified of the acceptance of such request via the Moway app. Moway is not responsible for the provision of transport services. Moway does not provide trips and is not a party to your agreement with the relevant Provider.</p>
                                <p>4.2 You can cancel your request for a transport service in the Moway app free of charge before a Provider has accepted such request.</p>
                                <p>4.3 If you cancel your request for the transport service in the Moway app after a Provider has accepted such request (after a transportation contract has been concluded), you may be charged with a cancellation fee. </p>
                                <p>4.4 If you cancel a transport service request on multiple successive instances, we may temporarily block your account as a warning. After several warnings, we may suspend your account for a longer period (an upward of 6 months). After that period, you may contact us and ask for your account to be reactivated and your application will be reviewed by Moway.</p>
                                <p>4.5 If a Provider notifies you via the Moway app about the arrival of the vehicle at the pick-up location and the passenger (or people for whom the transport was ordered) do not arrive at the vehicle within a certain time period as specified in the Moway app, the order may be cancelled and in this case a cancellation fee will be charged. In case a Driver decides to cancel your request, please note that Moway is not responsible for such situations.</p>
                                <p>4.6 Once the Provider notifies you via the Moway app that the Driver has arrived at the pick-up location, the Moway app may begin charging fare on a waiting time basis according to the rates specified in the Moway app. </p>
                                <p>4.7 If you have requested transport services using the Moway app and cause damage to the Driver’s vehicle or its furnishing (among else, by blemishing or staining the vehicle or causing the vehicle to stink), the Provider will have the right to require you to pay a penalty and require compensation for any damages exceeding the penalty. If you do not pay the penalty and/or compensate for the damage, Moway may pursue the claims on behalf of the Provider of the transport service. </p>
                                <h3 class="title">5. License to use Moway app </h3>
                                <p>5.1 As long as you comply with these General Terms and Conditions, we agree to grant you a right to access and use the Moway app in accordance with these General Terms and Conditions, the Privacy Notice and the applicable app-store terms. You may not transfer or sub-license this right to use the Moway app. In the event that your right to use the Moway app is terminated, the corresponding non-exclusive license will also be terminated. </p>
                                <h3 class="title"></h3>
                                <p>Nothing in these General Terms and Conditions limits and excludes any liability which cannot legally be limited or excluded, including liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence and liability for fraud or alter your rights as a consumer that cannot be excluded under applicable law. </p>
                                <p>6.1 As the Moway app is an information community service (a means of communication) between passengers and Providers, we cannot guarantee or take any responsibility for the quality or the absence of defects in the provision of transport services. Since the respective contract for the provision of a transport service is concluded exclusively between you and the respective Provider, we are not liable for any damages arising from, in connection with or within the scope of such contractual relationship between you and the Provider (e.g. damage to the vehicle, accident). As the usage of Moway app for requesting transport services depends on the behaviour of the Providers, Moway does not guarantee that you will always have offers available for the provision of the transport services. </p>
                                <p>6.2 The Moway app does not offer or broker transport services for passengers. It is also not a transport agency service for finding passengers for transport providers. The Moway app is used as a means for organising the provision of transport services. </p>
                                <p>6.3 The consumer’s right of refund is not applied to Moway app orders. Requesting a refund from the transport service Provider does not withdraw you from the Agreement under which the provision of the transport service was ordered. </p>
                                <p>6.4 The Moway app is provided on an "as is" and “as available” basis. Moway does not represent, warrant or guarantee that access to the Moway app will be uninterrupted or error free. In case of any faults in the software, we will endeavour to correct them as soon as possible, but please keep in mind that the functioning of the app may be restricted due to occasional technical errors and we are not able to guarantee that the app will function at all times, for example a public emergency may result in a service interruption. </p>
                                <p>6.5 Except in case of wilful misconduct, gross negligence and nonperformance of essential obligations, Moway, its representatives, directors and employees are not liable for any loss or damage that you may incur as a result of using the Moway app or relying on the trip contracted for through the Moway app, including but not limited to: </p>
                                <ul class="blog-list">
                                    <li>6.5.1. any direct or indirect property damage or monetary loss; </li>
                                    <li>6.5.2. loss of profit; </li>
                                    <li>6.5.3. loss of business, contracts, contacts, goodwill, reputation and any loss that may arise from interruption of the Moway app; </li>
                                    <li>6.5.4. loss or inaccuracy of data; </li>
                                    <li>6.5.5 damage or loss arising out of any transaction between you and a Provider; and any other type of loss or damage. </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>6.6 To the maximum extent permitted by the applicable law, you will have the right to claim for damages only if Moway deliberately violated the Agreement, did not perform essential obligations of the Agreement or committed gross negligence. Moway will not be liable for the actions or inactions of the Provider and will not be liable for damages that the Provider may cause to the passengers. </p>
                                <p>6.7 You agree to fully indemnify and hold Moway, their affiliate companies, representatives, employees and directors harmless from any claims or losses (including liabilities, damages, costs and expenses of any nature) that they suffer as a result of your use of the Moway app (including the trips you obtain through your use of the Moway app). </p>
                                <p>6.8 Moway may immediately end your use of the Moway app if you breach these General Terms and Conditions or we consider it necessary to protect the integrity of Moway or the safety of Providers. </p>
                                <h3 class="title">7.Good Practice using the Moway app </h3>
                                <p>7.1 As Moway is not a provider or broker of the transport services, any issues with defects or quality of the transport services will be resolved in accordance with the rules and regulations of the transport service Provider or the relevant public authority. </p>
                                <p>7.2 We ask you to fill out a feedback form in the Moway app. This enables us to offer suggestions to the Providers for improving the quality of their services. </p>
                                <p>7.3 We expect that you use the Moway app in good faith and be respectful of the Providers who offer their services through the Moway app. We want everyone to have safe, smooth, and memorable experiences with Moway. By following these guidelines, you help us keep drivers safe and happy, and on the road for you. </p>
                                <p>By protecting the integrity of our platform, we ensure that Providers are able to provide services in a safe and productive environment, passengers receive prompt and delightful services, and the Moway platform can continue to function in a sustainable way. </p>
                                <p>These are simple rules of thumb passengers should follow: </p>
                                <p>Always be kind to your Driver and respectful of their car; </p>
                                <p>Try not to cancel your ride unless you absolutely have to, it will take you longer to get where you are going, and it wastes the Driver’s time; </p>
                                <p>Always show up for your ride. Keep an eye out for the Driver arriving, and don’t keep them waiting too long. </p>
                                <p>Consistent failure to uphold any one of the above standards is directly harming the integrity of the Moway platform and is sufficient to prompt a warning or suspension of ability to use the Moway platform. Moway retains the right to close your account if you have violated the terms set out in this General Terms and Conditions or if your activities are malicious (such as withholding payment for the provision of the transport service, fraud, being disrespectful towards the Drivers, etc). In these cases, your Moway app account may be revoked without prior notice. </p>
                                <p>7.4 Moway will make every effort to ensure that only Drivers who have integrity and are respectful of their profession and passengers, use the Moway app. However, we are in no position to guarantee that every Provider of transport services, located by the Moway app, satisfies the aforementioned criteria at all times. If you experience objectionable transport service, please notify the company responsible for the service, a supervisory authority or our customer support. </p>
                                <h3 class="title">8. Amendments to the General Terms and Conditions </h3>
                                <p>
                                    8.1 We may change these General Terms and Conditions from time to time. We will inform you of changes within a reasonable time period. You will be bound by such changes upon their notification to you in the Moway app and/or by email but if you do not agree with these changes, you are free to close your account. We may assign, subcontract or transfer these General Terms and Conditions or any of our rights or obligations in them, in whole or in part, without your prior consent, provided this will not lead to a reduction of the rights you are entitled to by virtue of these General Terms and Conditions or by law. You may not assign, subcontract or transfer these General Terms and Conditions or any of your rights or obligations, in whole or in part, as your use of the Moway's app is personal, unless agreed otherwise. </p>
                                    <h3 class="">9. Privacy </h3>

                                    <p>10. Final Provisions As far as legally enforceable, the General Terms and Conditions will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. If the respective dispute resulting from General Terms or Agreement could not be settled by the negotiations, then the dispute will be finally solved before the competent courts of the passenger’s domicile. If any provision of the General Terms is held to be unenforceable, the parties will substitute for the affected provision an enforceable provision that approximates the intent and economic effect of the affected provision. </p>
